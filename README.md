**Monitoring Beaver-induced flooding in Estonia**

Beavers are said to be ecosystem engineers and are essential for sustaining wetland and floodplain habitats in many landscapes. However, Beavers are blames for creating dams that strongly influences the flow of water 
and causes floods that damage natural vegetation in Forest ecosystem. This project aims to detect Beaver damaged forest areas in Estonian forest by using Sentinel-2 satellite imageries, orthophotos and Beaver sight location data. 
The satellite imagery was used to detect the location of floods damage and to access the pattern of forest damage around water bodies, the contour of the study area was used to extract the total area of interest and the known beaver points 
served as a reference in the identification of active beaver locations for the collection of training samples for the Random Forest algorithm. Accuracy was 91%, precision was 66% and Cohenâ€™s kappa was 0.65.
