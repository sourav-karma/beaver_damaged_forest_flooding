**Monitoring Beaver-induced flooding in Estonia**

This study focuses on identifying areas of forest damage caused by beavers within Estonian forests, utilizing a combination of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, orthophotos, and known beaver sighting data. By analyzing the satellite imagery, the project aimed to pinpoint locations of flood damage and assess the extent of forest disturbance near water bodies. The study area's contour was employed to delineate the total area of interest, while known beaver sighting locations served as reference points for identifying active beaver habitats and collecting training samples for the Random Forest algorithm. The analysis achieved an accuracy of 91%, with a precision of 66% and Cohenâ€™s kappa coefficient of 0.65, indicating substantial agreement between predicted and observed forest damage due to beaver activity. This approach provides a valuable tool for monitoring and managing beaver-related ecological impacts in forest ecosystems, aiding in conservation efforts and mitigating potential flood risks.
